# LSTM-Based Mobile Legend Hero Counter Predictor

## Description
The LSTM-Based Mobile Legend Hero Counter Predictor project focuses on predicting the win rates and pick rates of Mobile Legends heroes using Random Forest and LSTM models. It also includes functionality to recommend counter heroes for enemy teams based on lanes and roles, and to calculate the win rate of a team.

### Features
- **Hero Prediction**: Predicts the win rate and pick rate of Mobile Legends heroes.
- **Counter Recommendation**: Recommends counter heroes based on enemy picks, lanes, and roles.
- **Team Win Rate Calculation**: Calculates the win rate of a team based on hero picks, counters, lanes, and roles.
